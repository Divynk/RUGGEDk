			<p>RUGGED was founded by team Rugged in 2023, who had a vision of creating an e-commerce platform that would revolutionize the way people shop for camping materials and would simplify the process of choosing and planning for their trips. Our founder realized that traditional brick-and-mortar stores were limiting, and that online shopping offered a level of convenience and accessibility that had never been seen before.</p>
